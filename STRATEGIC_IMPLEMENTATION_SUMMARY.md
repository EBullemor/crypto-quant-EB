- **Reduced Correlated Exposure**: 20% â†’ 15% (better diversification)

**Expected Impact**: Reduced drawdown and volatility while maintaining alpha generation

### 2. âœ… Maintained Breakout Focus

**Problem Identified**: Breakout signal was highest contributor but could be optimized

**Solutions Implemented**:
- **Increased Breakout Weight**: 1.0 â†’ 1.3 (30% increase)
- **Optimized Parameters**:
  - Channel Period: 30 â†’ 25 (faster response)
  - ATR Period: 14 â†’ 10 (quicker adaptation)
  - ATR Multiplier: 2.0 â†’ 1.8 (less aggressive entries)

**Expected Impact**: Enhanced breakout signal generation while maintaining effectiveness

### 3. âœ… Optimized for Current Market

**Problem Identified**: Allocation method could be better suited for current conditions

**Solutions Implemented**:
- **Changed Allocation Method**: RISK_PARITY â†’ CONFIDENCE_WEIGHTED
- **Reduced Signal Confidence Threshold**: 0.30 â†’ 0.20 (more signals)
- **Enhanced Signal Parameters**:
  - Momentum: 30 â†’ 25 days lookback, 100 â†’ 80 MA window
  - Mean Reversion: 5 â†’ 7 days lookback, 1.8 â†’ 1.6 z-score threshold

**Expected Impact**: Better adaptation to current market conditions and increased signal activity

### 4. âœ… Expanded Funding Carry Utilization

**Problem Identified**: Funding carry signal showed minimal activity (0.0% contribution)

**Solutions Implemented**:
- **Reduced Funding Threshold**: 0.0005 â†’ 0.0003 (40% reduction)
- **Adjusted Weight**: 1.5 â†’ 1.2 (better balance)
- **Reduced Max Allocation**: 15% â†’ 12% (safety)

**Expected Impact**: Increased funding carry signal activity and contribution

### 5. âœ… New Risk Controls Added

**Problem Identified**: Limited risk monitoring and control mechanisms

**Solutions Implemented**:
- **Daily Drawdown Limit**: 15%
- **Weekly Drawdown Limit**: 25%
- **Position Sizing Method**: Kelly Optimal
- **Enhanced Monitoring**: Daily, weekly, monthly metrics
- **Performance Tracking**: Comprehensive dashboard

**Expected Impact**: Better risk monitoring and control
