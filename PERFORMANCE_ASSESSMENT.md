2. **Optimize Skip Period**: 7 → 3-5 days
   - **Rationale**: Reduce signal lag while maintaining noise reduction
   - **Expected Impact**: Faster signal response

3. **Dynamic MA Window**: 200 → 50-100 (market regime dependent)
   - **Rationale**: Shorter MA for more responsive trend detection
   - **Expected Impact**: Better trend alignment

4. **Enhanced Volatility Targeting**: Current 15% → Dynamic 10-20%
   - **Rationale**: Adjust for market conditions
   - **Expected Impact**: Better risk-adjusted returns

### B. Portfolio Allocation Optimization

#### Current Allocation:
- Directional: 25% (recently increased)
- Market-Neutral: 15% (recently decreased)
- Overlay: 8%

#### Recommended Rebalancing:
1. **Performance-Weighted Allocation**:
   - Breakout: 35% (highest performer)
   - Mean Reversion: 25% 
   - Momentum: 15% (until optimized)
   - Market-Neutral: 20%
   - Overlay: 5%

2. **Dynamic Weight Adjustment**:
   - Implement 30-day rolling performance tracking
   - Auto-adjust weights based on recent performance
   - Cap individual signal weights at 40%

### C. Risk Management Enhancements

#### Current Risk Limits:
- Max leverage: 4.0
- Max net exposure: 40%
- Stop loss: 3%

#### Proposed Improvements:
1. **Dynamic Stop Losses**: 3% → 2-5% based on volatility
2. **Volatility-Adjusted Position Sizing**: Implement across all signals
3. **Correlation Risk Management**: Real-time correlation monitoring with position reduction

## 💡 Key Insights & Recommendations

### 🎯 **Primary Focus**: Momentum Signal Optimization
The momentum signal is significantly underperforming and has been over-weighted in the recent bull market optimization. This is the #1 priority for performance improvement.

### 📈 **Leverage Top Performers**: 
The breakout signal is performing exceptionally well (2.00 Sharpe) and should receive higher allocation while maintaining diversification.

### ⚖️ **Balance Risk vs Return**:
Recent bull market optimizations increased risk but may have over-optimized for momentum which is currently underperforming.

### 🔄 **Dynamic Adaptation**:
Implement performance tracking and automatic weight adjustment to prevent prolonged underperformance from dragging down the portfolio.
