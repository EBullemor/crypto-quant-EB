# Bull Market Optimization: Enhanced Signal Weighting and Risk Management

## 🎯 Overview
This PR implements comprehensive bull market optimizations to the crypto quantitative trading bot, focusing on momentum-driven strategies, enhanced position sizing, and improved risk management for trending market conditions.

## 🚀 Key Changes

### 1. **Signal Weight Optimization**
- **Momentum Signal**: Increased weight from `1.0` → `2.5` (150% increase)
- **Mean Reversion**: Reduced weight from `0.8` → `0.6` (less counter-trend focus)
- **Mean Reversion Threshold**: Raised from `2.0` → `2.5` (less sensitive in bull markets)

### 2. **Enhanced Position Sizing**
- **Max Leverage**: Increased from `3.0` → `4.0` 
- **Position Sizing Method**: Changed to `kelly_optimal` for dynamic sizing
- **Trend Amplification**: Added up to 50% position boost for strong momentum signals
- **Min Leverage Floor**: Raised from `1.0` → `1.2` for more active positioning

### 3. **Portfolio Allocation Rebalancing**
- **Directional Signals**: Increased allocation from `15%` → `25%` (+67%)
- **Market-Neutral Signals**: Reduced allocation from `20%` → `15%` (-25%)
- **Overlay Signals**: Slightly increased from `5%` → `8%`

### 4. **Risk Management Enhancements**
- **Stop Loss**: Tightened from `5%` → `3%` for better drawdown protection
- **Max Net Exposure**: Increased from `30%` → `40%`
- **Progressive Drawdown Protection**: Added 0-30% position reduction during adverse periods
- **Correlation Limits**: Reduced from `25%` → `20%` for better diversification

### 5. **Bull Market Features**
- **Trend Amplification Logic**: Strong signals (>0.7) get enhanced positioning
- **Dynamic Drawdown Adjustment**: Automatic position scaling based on recent performance
- **Enhanced Volatility Targeting**: Directional vol target increased from `10%` → `12%`

## 📈 Expected Impact

### Performance Improvements
- **Higher capture ratio** during bull market trends
- **Reduced lag** in momentum-driven moves
- **Better risk-adjusted returns** through dynamic sizing

### Risk Management
- **Faster drawdown recovery** through progressive position adjustment
- **Reduced correlation risk** through improved diversification
- **Enhanced stop-loss efficiency** with tighter 3% stops

## 🧪 Technical Implementation

### Files Modified
- `src/quantbot/config/default.yaml` - Core signal weights and risk parameters
- `src/quantbot/portfolio/blender_v2.py` - Enhanced blending logic and risk controls

### New Features Added
1. **`_calculate_drawdown_adjustment()`** - Progressive position sizing based on recent performance
2. **Trend amplification logic** in `_blend_directional_signals()` 
3. **Enhanced risk limits** with bull market optimizations

## 🔍 Testing & Validation
- ✅ All signal weights validated for proper normalization
- ✅ Risk limits tested for boundary conditions
- ✅ Drawdown protection logic verified
- ✅ No breaking changes to existing signal interfaces

## 🎛️ Configuration Summary

| Parameter | Before | After | Change |
|-----------|--------|-------|---------|
| Momentum Weight | 1.0 | 2.5 | +150% |
| Max Leverage | 3.0 | 4.0 | +33% |
| Stop Loss | 5% | 3% | Tighter |
| Directional Allocation | 15% | 25% | +67% |
| Market-Neutral Allocation | 20% | 15% | -25% |
| Max Net Exposure | 30% | 40% | +33% |

## 🚦 Deployment Notes
- **Backward Compatible**: No breaking changes to existing signal APIs
- **Environment Variables**: No new env vars required
